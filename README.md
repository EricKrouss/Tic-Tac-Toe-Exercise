Tic-Tack-Toe in React.
This was made as an exercise in React for my MIT xPro Full Stack Development Course.
It functions just as you'd expect a Tick Tack Toe game to function, written exclusively in JavaScript using the React Framework.

Roadmap of Future Improvement:
-When a person wins, have the winning squares blink colors, on and off, to indicate to the players where the winning squares are.

-Improve styling to differentiate Player X from Player O.
